# Question 3_1
## How many stacks would you need to implement a Queue
#### With 2 stacks you can imitate a queue.
#### First stack to take the input.
#### Second stack to reverse the stack each time you have new entry in the first stack.

# Question 3_2
## What is the difference between a Queue and Stack
#### A Stack is a data structure that uses the LIFO which is known as Last In First Out method to manipulate data.
#### An example of a stack method is Piling a plates on ontop themselves after washing them, the last plate is always ontop and is attended to first before moving to the second plate that was placed second to the last until the stack of plates has been finished.
#### A Queue is a data structure that uses the FIFO which is known as the First In First Out to manipulate data.
#### An example of a queue is the amount of people queuing in front of an ATM Gallery, the first person to enter the queue will be the first person to use the ATM Gallery and that happens until the queue ends
